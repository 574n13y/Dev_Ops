1. **Linux**: Use the `ls` command to list files in a directory. What does the `-l` option add to the output?
  - The `ls` command lists files in a directory. Adding the `-l` option provides a long listing format, which includes more detailed information about each file, such as file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and timestamp of the last modification.

2. **Networking**: Explain the OSI model. Which layer does HTTP operate on?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers:
   - Layer 1: **Physical** – Deals with hardware transmission of raw bit streams.
   - Layer 2: **Data Link** – Manages node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
   - Layer 3: **Network** – Responsible for routing, forwarding, and addressing (e.g., IP).
   - Layer 4: **Transport** – Manages end-to-end communication and data flow (e.g., TCP, UDP).
   - Layer 5: **Session** – Manages sessions or connections between applications.
   - Layer 6: **Presentation** – Translates data formats and encrypts/decrypts data.
   - Layer 7: **Application** – Provides application-level services and network access for end-users.
   
   HTTP operates on the **Application layer** (Layer 7).

3. **Cloud Computing**: What is IaaS? Name three popular IaaS providers and their core services.
4. **DevOps**: Explain the concept of Continuous Integration. Why is it important?
5. **Tools & Technology**: What is Docker? Install Docker on your system and run a simple `hello-world` container.
6. **Scenario**: You need to troubleshoot an application that’s not accessible from outside the network. What steps would you take to diagnose the issue?
