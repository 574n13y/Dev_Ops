# Day 71


1. **Linux**: Set up basic SSH configurations and keys.
   * Steps to Configure SSH and Keys:  
    
    1. **Generate SSH Keys**:  
       ```bash
       ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
       ```
    - Save the key pair to a location (default is `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
    - Add a passphrase for additional security.
    
    2. **Copy Public Key to Remote Server**:  
       ```bash
       ssh-copy-id user@remote_server
       ```
   This adds the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server.
    
    3. **Set Up SSH Config File**:  
       Create or edit the SSH config file:  
       ```bash
       nano ~/.ssh/config
       ```
      Example configuration:  
      ```
      Host my-server
          HostName 192.168.1.100
          User user
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
      ```
      Connect using:  
      ```bash
      ssh my-server
      ```


2. **Networking**: Describe the differences between public and private IP addresses.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain cross-region replication in S3.

4. **DevOps**: What is the purpose of feature flags in deployments?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Configure cross-region replication for an S3 bucket.

6. **Scenario**: You need to replicate data across regions for high availability. How would you set this up?
