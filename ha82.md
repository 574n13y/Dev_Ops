1. **Linux**: Use `scp` to securely transfer files between remote systems.
   - `scp` (Secure Copy) is used to securely transfer files between local and remote systems over SSH.

   **Example Commands:**
   - Copy a file from local to remote:
     ```sh
     scp myfile.txt user@remote:/home/user/
     ```
   - Copy a file from remote to local:
     ```sh
     scp user@remote:/home/user/myfile.txt .
     ```
   - Copy an entire directory:
     ```sh
     scp -r myfolder user@remote:/home/user/
     ```


2. **Networking**: Explain NAT gateways and instances and their role in VPCs.
   - Both NAT Gateways and NAT Instances allow instances in **private subnets** to access the internet **without** exposing them to inbound connections.

   | Feature            | NAT Gateway                   | NAT Instance                  |
   |-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
   | **Managed by AWS** | Yes                          | No (user-managed EC2 instance) |
   | **High Availability** | Multi-AZ support            | No (single point of failure) |
   | **Scaling**        | Scales automatically        | Needs manual scaling         |
   | **Performance**    | Higher performance          | Limited by EC2 type          |
   | **Use Case**      | Recommended for production  | Used in cost-sensitive cases |

   **âœ… Best Practice**: Use **NAT Gateway** for better availability and performance.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe Amazon CloudWatch Alarms.

4. **DevOps**: What is synthetic monitoring, and how does it help in proactive monitoring?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Create a CloudWatch Alarm to monitor EC2 CPU usage.

6. **Scenario**: You want to receive alerts when server utilization crosses a threshold. How would you set this up?
