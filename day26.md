1. **Linux**: Use the `rm` command to delete files and directories.
   * The `rm` command in Linux is used to delete files and directories. It removes the file entries from the file system and frees up the associated disk space.  

#### Syntax:  
```bash
rm [options] <file/directory>
```

#### Examples:  
- **Delete a single file:**  
  ```bash
  rm file.txt
  ```  
- **Delete multiple files:**  
  ```bash
  rm file1.txt file2.txt
  ```  
- **Delete a directory and its contents recursively:**  
  ```bash
  rm -r directory/
  ```  
- **Force delete without confirmation:**  
  ```bash
  rm -rf directory/
  ```  
**Caution:** Use `rm -rf` carefully as it permanently deletes files and directories.
