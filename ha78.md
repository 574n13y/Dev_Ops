# Day 78


1. **Linux**: Set up user permissions with `usermod`, `groupadd`, and `chmod`.
   - Managing user permissions is critical for security and access control in Linux.  

   - **`usermod`**: Modify user properties (e.g., adding a user to a group).  
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG developers alice  # Add 'alice' to the 'developers' group
     ```
   - **`groupadd`**: Create a new group.  
     ```bash
     sudo groupadd admins
     ```
   - **`chmod`**: Change file permissions.  
     ```bash
     chmod 750 script.sh  # Only owner and group can execute
     ```


2. **Networking**: Explain VPNs and their role in secure remote access.
   - A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** allows secure remote access by encrypting traffic between a client and a private network.  

   - **Use Cases**:  
    - Secure access to internal cloud resources.  
    - Encrypt data between remote employees and corporate networks.  
    - Connect multiple cloud environments securely (e.g., AWS VPN, OpenVPN).  

   - **Example: AWS Client VPN**  
    - AWS offers **Client VPN** for secure, managed VPN connectivity.  
    - Supports **SSL-based** authentication.  


3. **Cloud Computing**: Define AWS Organizations and its use in multi-account setups.

4. **DevOps**: Explain deployment rollbacks and how to handle failed deployments.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up AWS Organizations and create a sub-account.

6. **Scenario**: Your company needs centralized account management for different teams. How would you organize it?
