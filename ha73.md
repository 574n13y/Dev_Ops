# Day 73


1. **Linux**: Use `cron` to set up automated tasks.
   - The `cron` service allows you to schedule repetitive tasks. You can create or edit a cron job by running `crontab -e`. For example, to run a script every day at 2:00 AM:  
     ```bash  
     0 2 * * * /path/to/your_script.sh  
     ```  
This ensures your script is executed daily without manual intervention.


2. **Networking**: What are NAT instances, and why are they used in VPCs?

3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain AWS Step Functions and their use cases.

4. **DevOps**: Define build artifacts and why theyâ€™re useful.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Create a simple workflow in AWS Step Functions.

6. **Scenario**: Your application has multiple dependent steps in processing. How would you orchestrate this?
