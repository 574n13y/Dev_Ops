# Day 73


1. **Linux**: Use `cron` to set up automated tasks.
   - The `cron` service allows you to schedule repetitive tasks. You can create or edit a cron job by running `crontab -e`. For example, to run a script every day at 2:00 AM:  
     ```bash  
     0 2 * * * /path/to/your_script.sh  
     ```  
This ensures your script is executed daily without manual intervention.


2. **Networking**: What are NAT instances, and why are they used in VPCs?
   - NAT (Network Address Translation) instances are special EC2 instances configured to allow instances in private subnets to access the internet while preventing inbound traffic from the internet. They are used in VPCs to enable secure outbound internet access for private resources like database instances.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain AWS Step Functions and their use cases.
   * AWS Step Functions is a serverless workflow orchestration service that coordinates multiple AWS services. It defines workflows as a series of steps, making it easy to handle complex processes such as:  
    - **Data processing pipelines**  
    - **ETL workflows**  
    - **Microservice orchestration**  
    - **Task retries and exception handling**


4. **DevOps**: Define build artifacts and why theyâ€™re useful.
    - Build artifacts are the files or binaries generated during the software build process, such as `.jar` files, `.war` files, or compiled executables. They are useful because they encapsulate the application code in a deployable format, ensuring consistency across different environments (e.g., staging, production).


5. **Tools & Technology**: Create a simple workflow in AWS Step Functions.
    - A simple JSON definition for an AWS Step Functions workflow:  
```json  
{  
  "Comment": "Simple Step Functions Workflow",  
  "StartAt": "Step1",  
  "States": {  
    "Step1": {  
      "Type": "Task",  
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:your-lambda",  
      "Next": "Step2"  
    },  
    "Step2": {  
      "Type": "Succeed"  
    }  
  }  
}  
```  
- **Step1** triggers a Lambda function.  
- **Step2** marks the workflow as successful.  
Deploy it in the AWS Step Functions console.


6. **Scenario**: Your application has multiple dependent steps in processing. How would you orchestrate this?
