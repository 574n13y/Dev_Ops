    * The `cat` command is used to read and concatenate files. Besides viewing files, it supports several options:

  cat filename
  ```

- **Options**:  
  - `-n`: Number all lines.  
    ```bash
    cat -n filename
    ```
  - `-b`: Number non-blank lines only.  
    ```bash
    cat -b filename
    ```
  - `-s`: Suppress repeated blank lines.  
    ```bash
    cat -s filename
    ```
  - `-E`: Show end-of-line characters (`$`).  
    ```bash
    cat -E filename
    ```
