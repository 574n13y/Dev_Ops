# Day 27


1. **Linux**: Use the `cat` command to view files. What other options are available?
    * The `cat` command is used to read and concatenate files. Besides viewing files, it supports several options:

- **Basic Usage**:  
  ```bash
  cat filename
  ```

- **Options**:  
  - `-n`: Number all lines.  
    ```bash
    cat -n filename
    ```
  - `-b`: Number non-blank lines only.  
    ```bash
    cat -b filename
    ```
  - `-s`: Suppress repeated blank lines.  
    ```bash
    cat -s filename
    ```
  - `-E`: Show end-of-line characters (`$`).  
    ```bash
    cat -E filename
    ```

Other tools like `less`, `more`, or `head`/`tail` can be alternatives for specific needs.


2. **Networking**: Define the term "default gateway."
    * A **default gateway** is a network node that serves as an access point to another network, typically outside the local subnet. Itâ€™s often used to connect devices to the internet.

- **Purpose**:  
  The default gateway directs traffic to destinations not within the local network by forwarding packets to an external router.

- **Example**:  
  If a device on a local network (192.168.1.10) wants to communicate with a public server (8.8.8.8), the default gateway (e.g., 192.168.1.1) handles this routing.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.
    * The AWS Shared Responsibility Model outlines the security responsibilities shared between AWS and the customer.

- **AWS Responsibility** (*Security of the Cloud*):  
  - Physical infrastructure, networking, and hypervisors.
  - Core services (e.g., storage, databases, compute).

- **Customer Responsibility** (*Security in the Cloud*):  
  - Data protection and encryption.
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management) configuration.
  - Application security and patching.

- **Example**:  
  AWS secures the S3 infrastructure, but you (the customer) must configure bucket permissions to prevent unauthorized access.


4. **DevOps**: Describe the importance of monitoring in DevOps.
5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up a basic Docker network between two containers.
6. **Scenario**: You need to troubleshoot connectivity issues between two containers. What steps would you take?
