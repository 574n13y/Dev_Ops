ðŸ”¸ AWS Interview Question:
What is the difference between EC2 On-Demand and EC2 Spot Instances?
- **EC2 On-Demand Instances** are virtual servers you can launch without long-term commitments, paying only for the compute capacity you use by the hour or second. They offer flexibility and are ideal for unpredictable workloads.

- **EC2 Spot Instances** allow you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at a lower cost (up to 90% off On-Demand prices). However, AWS can terminate Spot Instances if it needs the capacity back, making them suitable for flexible, fault-tolerant, or batch processing workloads.

ðŸ”¸ Linux Interview Question:
What is the difference between ls and ls -a in Linux?

- The `ls -a` command lists **all** files, including hidden ones (like `.bashrc` or `.gitignore`).

ðŸ”¸ Networking Interview Question:
What is an IP address, and how does it differ from a MAC address?
- An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to a device on a network, used to route data between devices over the internet or local networks. It can change and is assigned by the network.

- A **MAC address** (Media Access Control address) is a hardware identifier permanently assigned to a device's network interface card (NIC). It is unique to the device and remains constant regardless of the network it's connected to.
