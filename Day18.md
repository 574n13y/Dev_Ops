# Day 18

1. **Linux**: Use the `chmod` command to change permissions on a file. What does `chmod 755 filename` do?
   - The `chmod` command modifies file permissions. Running `chmod 755 filename` sets the permissions as follows:
     - `7` for the owner (read, write, execute)
     - `5` for the group (read and execute only)
     - `5` for others (read and execute only)
   - This means the owner can read, write, and execute the file, while group members and others can only read and execute it.


2. **Networking**: What is an IP address? How do you find your IP address in a Linux terminal?
3. **Cloud Computing**: What are Availability Zones? How do they help with fault tolerance in cloud environments?
4. **DevOps**: Define Continuous Delivery and compare it with Continuous Integration.
5. **Tools & Technology**: What is Kubernetes? Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or kind.
6. **Scenario**: You are tasked with automating a daily report generation process. How would you design a simple pipeline for this?
