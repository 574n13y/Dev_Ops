# Day 61


1. **Linux**: Experiment with `netstat` for network diagnostics.
   - The `netstat` command is a powerful tool to analyze network connections, routing tables, and port usage.  
    - **Basic Usage**:  
      ```bash
      netstat -a  # Displays all connections and listening ports  
      netstat -t  # Shows TCP connections  
      netstat -u  # Shows UDP connections  
      netstat -l  # Lists listening ports  
      netstat -r  # Displays the kernel routing table  
      netstat -s  # Displays network statistics  
      ```

   - **Common Scenarios**:  
    - Check for open ports and their associated services.
    - Diagnose network performance issues.
    - Identify suspicious network activity.


2. **Networking**: Explain IP address classes.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Discuss how S3 storage tiers work.

4. **DevOps**: Define automated testing and its importance in CI/CD.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up a simple testing pipeline in Jenkins.

6. **Scenario**: You need to automate unit tests for every code push. How would you do it?
