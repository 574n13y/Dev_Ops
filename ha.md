1. **Linux**: Use `lsof` to check open files and sockets.
   - **Command**: `lsof` (List Open Files) is a powerful Linux utility used to list all open files and the processes that opened them.  
   - **Use Cases**:  
    - Diagnose file-related issues (e.g., files that can't be deleted because they're in use).  
    - Identify network connections (e.g., sockets and ports in use).  
    - Monitor system activity.  
   - **Examples**:  
    - List all open files: `lsof`  
    - Check processes using a specific port: `lsof -i :8080`  
    - Find open files for a specific user: `lsof -u username`
