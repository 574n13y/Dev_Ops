# Day 72


1. **Linux**: Create simple shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
   - A script to back up a directory daily:
     
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     SOURCE="/path/to/source"
     DEST="/path/to/backup"
     TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
     BACKUP="$DEST/backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"
     tar -czf "$BACKUP" "$SOURCE"
     echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP"
     ```
     Save this as `backup.sh`, make it executable using `chmod +x backup.sh`, and schedule it with `cron` for daily automation.


2. **Networking**: Explain IPv6 and its advantages over IPv4.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe AWS KMS and its use in encryption.

4. **DevOps**: What is a release train, and how does it help in DevOps?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up basic key management using AWS KMS.
