# Day 80


1. **Linux**: Use `iptables` to set up basic firewall rules.
   - `iptables` is a tool to configure the Linux kernel firewall. Hereâ€™s how to set up some basic rules:

   - **Allow SSH (Port 22)**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
     ```
   - **Allow HTTP & HTTPS (Ports 80, 443)**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
     ```
   - **Block all incoming traffic except allowed**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
     sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
     ```
   - **Save Rules (Ubuntu/Debian)**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
     ```


2. **Networking**: Explain DHCP and its role in IP address assignment.
   - **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** is a network protocol that automatically assigns **IP addresses** to devices.
   - Without DHCP, devices would require manual IP configuration.
   - **How it works**:
    1. A new device sends a **DHCP Discovery** request.
    2. The **DHCP server** assigns an IP from its pool.
    3. The device receives **IP, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS settings**.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe AWS IAM roles and how they differ from IAM users.
   
   | Feature         | IAM Role | IAM User |
   |---------------|---------|---------|
   | Identity Type | Temporary security identity | Permanent user identity |
   | Credentials | Uses temporary STS tokens | Uses long-term credentials (username/password, access keys) |
   | Use Case | Assigned to AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) | Assigned to people or applications |
   | Security | More secure, no static credentials | Can be less secure if credentials are leaked |

   **Example**: An **IAM role** can be assigned to an **EC2 instance** to grant access to an **S3 bucket** without needing hardcoded credentials.


4. **DevOps**: What is the principle of least privilege, and how does it apply to IAM?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Create and assign an IAM role for an EC2 instance.

6. **Scenario**: You need secure, limited access to an S3 bucket for a specific application. How would you configure it?
