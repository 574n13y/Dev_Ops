# Day 80


1. **Linux**: Use `iptables` to set up basic firewall rules.
   - `iptables` is a tool to configure the Linux kernel firewall. Hereâ€™s how to set up some basic rules:

   - **Allow SSH (Port 22)**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
     ```
   - **Allow HTTP & HTTPS (Ports 80, 443)**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
     sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
     ```
   - **Block all incoming traffic except allowed**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
     sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
     ```
   - **Save Rules (Ubuntu/Debian)**
     ```sh
     sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
     ```


2. **Networking**: Explain DHCP and its role in IP address assignment.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe AWS IAM roles and how they differ from IAM users.

4. **DevOps**: What is the principle of least privilege, and how does it apply to IAM?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Create and assign an IAM role for an EC2 instance.

6. **Scenario**: You need secure, limited access to an S3 bucket for a specific application. How would you configure it?
