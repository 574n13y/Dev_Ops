# Day 55


1. **Linux**: Use `curl` to make HTTP requests from the command line.
   * **Command Examples:**
    - **Basic GET Request**:  
      ```bash
      curl http://example.com
      ```
      Fetches the webpage contents of `example.com`.
    
    - **POST Request**:  
      ```bash
      curl -X POST -d "key=value&key2=value2" http://example.com/endpoint
      ```
      Sends data to the specified endpoint.
    
    - **Fetch HTTP Headers**:  
      ```bash
      curl -I http://example.com
      ```
      Returns only the HTTP response headers.
     
    - **Download a File**:  
      ```bash
      curl -O http://example.com/file.zip
      ```
      Downloads a file to the current directory.


2. **Networking**: Explain Quality of Service (QoS) in networking.
   - **Definition**: QoS is a network feature that prioritizes certain types of traffic to ensure optimal performance, particularly for latency-sensitive applications like video conferencing or VoIP.
   - **How It Works**:
    - **Traffic Classification**: Data packets are classified based on their type (e.g., streaming, browsing).
    - **Prioritization**: High-priority traffic is assigned more bandwidth.
    - **Traffic Shaping**: Controls the data flow to reduce congestion.
   - **Use Cases**:
    - Prioritizing VoIP traffic in an office network.
    - Ensuring smooth video streaming during peak hours.
    - Managing bandwidth for mission-critical applications.


3. **Cloud Computing**: What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and what does it automate?
   - **Definition**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that automates application deployment, scaling, and management.
   - **What It Automates**:
    - **Provisioning**: Automatically sets up EC2 instances, load balancers, security groups, etc.
    - **Scaling**: Handles auto-scaling based on application load.
    - **Monitoring**: Integrates with CloudWatch for metrics and logs.
    - **Patching**: Keeps the underlying infrastructure up-to-date.
    - **Supported Environments**: Web applications in various languages, such as Python, Java, Node.js, Ruby, and .NET.
    - **Ideal For**: Teams that want to focus on development without managing infrastructure.


4. **DevOps**: Describe how a reverse proxy works and its benefits.
   - **Definition**: A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend server.
   - **Benefits**:
    - **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
    - **SSL Termination**: Offloads SSL/TLS encryption from backend servers.
    - **Caching**: Reduces backend load by caching frequent requests.
    - **Security**: Hides backend server details from clients and protects against DDoS attacks.
   - **Examples**: NGINX, HAProxy, and Apache HTTP Server.


5. **Tools & Technology**: Deploy a sample application with Elastic Beanstalk.
   * **Steps to Deploy:**
    1. **Install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI**:
       ```bash
       pip install awsebcli
       ```
    2. **Initialize the Environment**:
       ```bash
       eb init
       ```
       Follow the prompts to select your application and region.
    3. **Create an Application**:
    - Place your application files (e.g., `app.py` for Python) in a directory.
    - Ensure a configuration file, such as `requirements.txt` for Python, is included.
    4. **Deploy the Application**:
       ```bash
       eb create my-environment
       ```
    5. **Monitor the Deployment**:
       Use the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard or:
       ```bash
       eb status
       ```


6. **Scenario**: Your team needs a quick deployment solution. How would you set up Elastic Beanstalk?
   * **Steps to Set Up**:
    1. **Choose Elastic Beanstalk** for a quick and managed deployment solution.
    2. **Prepare the Application**:
    - Ensure the application adheres to Elastic Beanstalk's supported frameworks.
    3. **Deploy**:
    - Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to upload and deploy the application.
    4. **Enable Monitoring and Scaling**:
    - Configure auto-scaling for high traffic.
    - Monitor application performance using CloudWatch.
    5. **Integrate with CI/CD**:
    - Use AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to automate deployments.

Elastic Beanstalk simplifies deployments by managing infrastructure and scaling automatically. It's a great choice for teams prioritizing rapid iteration.
