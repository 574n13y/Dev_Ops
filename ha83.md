# Day 82 


1. **Linux**: Use `rsyslog` for centralized logging.
   - `rsyslog` is a powerful logging tool that can be used to collect logs from multiple sources and send them to a centralized server.  

   * **Steps to configure centralized logging using `rsyslog`:**  
    1. **Install `rsyslog` on both client and server:**  
       ```bash
       sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y rsyslog
       ```  
    
    2. **Enable remote logging on the server (`/etc/rsyslog.conf` or `/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf`):**  
       ```bash
       $ModLoad imtcp  
       $InputTCPServerRun 514  
       ```  
    
    3. **Configure clients to send logs to the server (`/etc/rsyslog.conf`):**  
       ```bash
       *.* @logserver_ip:514
       ```  
    
    4. **Restart the `rsyslog` service:**  
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
       ```  
    
    5. **Verify logs on the server (`/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`).**  


2. **Networking**: Explain SSL offloading and its benefits.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe AWS S3 lifecycle policies for managing object storage.

4. **DevOps**: What is the difference between logging and monitoring?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Configure an S3 lifecycle policy to transition objects to Glacier.

6. **Scenario**: You need to reduce costs for storing old files without deleting them. How would you configure this?
