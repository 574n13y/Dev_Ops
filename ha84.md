# Day 84


1. **Linux**: Set up SSH key-based authentication for remote access.
   - SSH key-based authentication improves security by **eliminating the need for passwords** while ensuring secure remote access.  
   
    * **Steps to Set Up SSH Key-Based Authentication:**  
    1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair (on local machine):**  
       ```bash
       ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
       ```  
    - Saves the private key (`id_rsa`) and public key (`id_rsa.pub`) in `~/.ssh/`  
    2. **Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server:**  
       ```bash
       ssh-copy-id user@remote-server
       ```  
       Or manually add the public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote machine.  
    3. **Set Proper Permissions:**  
       ```bash
       chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
       chmod 700 ~/.ssh
       ```  
    4. **Disable Password Authentication (optional, for better security):**  
       Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:  
       ```bash
       PasswordAuthentication no
       PubkeyAuthentication yes
       ```  
       Restart SSH:  
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart sshd
       ```  


2. **Networking**: What is Anycast, and how does it work in routing?

3. **Cloud Computing**: Define Amazon ECS and how it differs from EKS.

4. **DevOps**: Explain the role of observability in system reliability.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Launch a simple task on Amazon ECS.

6. **Scenario**: You need to deploy containerized applications without Kubernetes. What AWS service would you use?
