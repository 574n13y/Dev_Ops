ðŸ”¸ AWS Question:
What is an IAM policy in AWS, and how does it control access to resources? How do policies differ from roles?
-An IAM policy in AWS is a JSON document that defines permissions to access AWS resources. It specifies *who* can do *what* on *which resources*. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles. For example, a policy might allow an EC2 instance to access S3 buckets. *Roles* differ in that theyâ€™re assumed temporarily by entities like users or services for cross-account or service-based access, whereas policies define access permissions.
