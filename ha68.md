1. **Linux**: Practice creating and restoring backups using `tar`.
#### **Creating a Backup**:
```bash
tar -cvf backup.tar /path/to/directory
```
- **Options**:
  - `c`: Create an archive.
  - `v`: Verbose mode (displays files being added).
  - `f`: Specifies the filename of the archive.

#### **Restoring a Backup**:
```bash
tar -xvf backup.tar -C /path/to/restore/location
```
- **Options**:
  - `x`: Extract files from the archive.
  - `C`: Specifies the directory to restore files to.


2. **Networking**: What is IPsec, and where is it commonly used?
#### **Definition**:
- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**: A suite of protocols that secures IP communication by encrypting and authenticating packets.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Encryption**: Protects data from eavesdropping.
- **Authentication**: Verifies data origin and integrity.
- **Modes**:
  - **Transport Mode**: Encrypts the payload only.
  - **Tunnel Mode**: Encrypts the entire IP packet.

#### **Common Use Cases**:
- VPNs (Virtual Private Networks).
- Secure communication between cloud resources.
- Protecting sensitive data in transit.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain the role of CloudFront in AWS.
#### **What is CloudFront?**
- **Amazon CloudFront**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) that delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users globally with low latency.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Edge Locations**: Cached content is served from locations closer to users.
- **Security**: Integrates with AWS Shield, AWS WAF, and SSL/TLS.
- **Dynamic Content**: Optimizes dynamic and static content delivery.

#### **Use Cases**:
- Streaming media.
- Accelerating websites.
- Distributing APIs globally.


4. **DevOps**: Describe infrastructure monitoring and key metrics to monitor.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Configure CloudFront with an S3 bucket origin.

6. **Scenario**: Your web application needs global content distribution. How would you set it up?
