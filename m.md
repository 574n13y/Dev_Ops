# Day 46

1. **Linux**: Use netstat to check network connections.
   * The `netstat` command is used to display active network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. It’s a powerful tool for diagnosing network issues and monitoring network activity.

   ##### **Examples**:
   - **List all active connections**:
       ```bash
       netstat -a
       ```
   - **Show active TCP connections**:
       ```bash
       netstat -at
       ```
   - **Show listening ports**:
       ```bash
       netstat -l
       ```
   - **Display processes associated with network connections**:
       ```bash
       netstat -tp
       ```
   - **Check statistics for a specific protocol (e.g., TCP)**:
       ```bash
       netstat -st
       ```


2. **Networking**: Describe network latency and its impact on applications.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain the role of Amazon CloudFront.

4. **DevOps**: What’s the difference between build, test, and deploy stages in CI/CD?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up a Jenkins job to deploy code to an S3 bucket.

6. **Scenario**: Your team wants to distribute content globally. What solutions would you suggest?
