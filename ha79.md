# Day 79



1. **Linux**: Explore process management with `nice` and `renice`.
   - In Linux, **`nice`** and **`renice`** manage process priority to control CPU usage:  
    
    1. **`nice` â€“ Set Process Priority on Start**
    - The **nice value** ranges from **-20 (highest priority)** to **19 (lowest priority)**.
    - Example: Start a process with a lower priority:  
      ```bash
      nice -n 10 python3 script.py
      ```
    
    2. **`renice` â€“ Change Priority of a Running Process**
    - Use **`renice`** to adjust the priority of an existing process:  
      ```bash
      renice -5 -p 1234  # Increase priority for process with PID 1234
      ```

  ðŸ”¹ **Use Case:** Optimize system performance by lowering non-critical background tasks (e.g., backups, indexing) and giving priority to critical workloads.  


2. **Networking**: Explain DNS forwarding and its use cases.
   - DNS forwarding **redirects queries** from one DNS server to another, usually when the server **cannot resolve** the request itself.  

   * **Types of DNS Forwarding**  
    1. **Conditional Forwarding** â€“ Forward requests to a specific server based on domain name.  
    2. **Recursive Forwarding** â€“ Forward all unknown queries to an external resolver (e.g., Google's `8.8.8.8`).  

   * **Use Cases**  
    - **Corporate Networks**: Internal DNS servers forward unresolved requests to a public DNS.  
    - **Hybrid Cloud**: On-prem servers forward cloud-based domain queries to AWS Route 53.  
    - **Content Filtering**: Organizations use DNS forwarding to enforce access policies via third-party resolvers.  

  ðŸ”¹ **Example in AWS:** Route 53 **Resolver Forwarding** is used for hybrid architectures.  


3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe the components of AWS CloudFormation and create a simple CloudFormation template.
   * **Key Components of AWS CloudFormation**  
    1. **Templates** â€“ YAML/JSON files that define infrastructure.  
    2. **Stacks** â€“ A collection of AWS resources managed as a unit.  
    3. **Change Sets** â€“ Preview changes before applying them.  
    4. **Drift Detection** â€“ Identify manual modifications outside CloudFormation.  

   * **Example: Deploy an EC2 Instance with CloudFormation**  
     
     ```yaml
     AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
     Resources:
       MyEC2Instance:
         Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
         Properties:
           InstanceType: t2.micro
           ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890
           KeyName: my-key-pair
           Tags:
             - Key: Name
             Value: MyInstance
     ```

   ðŸ”¹ **Why Use CloudFormation?**  
    - Automates infrastructure as code (IaC).  
    - Ensures repeatable deployments.  
    - Provides rollback and change tracking.  


4. **DevOps**: Define Idempotency in configuration management and its importance.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Deploy an EC2 instance using CloudFormation.

6. **Scenario**: You need to automate infrastructure creation for different environments. How would you design it?
