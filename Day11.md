ðŸ”¸ Networking Question:
What is MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), and how does it affect network performance? How would you troubleshoot MTU-related issues?
- MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is the largest data packet size that can be sent over a network. If the MTU is too large for the network, it may cause fragmentation, affecting performance. To troubleshoot, adjust MTU size and use commands like `ping` with the `-f` and `-s` options to test packet sizes.
