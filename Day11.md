AWS CloudTrail records and logs API calls made in your AWS account, providing visibility into user actions and resource changes for auditing and monitoring.

ðŸ”¸ Linux Question:
How would you find the 10 largest files in a directory and its subdirectories on a Linux system? What command would you use?

The `umask` command sets default permissions for newly created files and directories by specifying which permission bits to mask out. It subtracts permissions from the system default (666 for files, 777 for directories). You can modify the default `umask` value by adding a `umask` command in the userâ€™s shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.profile`).
