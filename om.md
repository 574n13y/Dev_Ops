# Day 36



1. **Linux**: Use `diff` to compare two files.
   * The `diff` command in Linux compares two files line by line and outputs the differences.  
    
     **Example Usage:**  
      ```bash
      diff file1.txt file2.txt
      ```
   - Output uses:  
    - `<` for lines in `file1` but not in `file2`.  
    - `>` for lines in `file2` but not in `file1`.  
     **Useful Options:**  
    - `diff -y file1.txt file2.txt`: Displays side-by-side comparison.  
    - `diff -c file1.txt file2.txt`: Context format to show surrounding lines for better understanding.
