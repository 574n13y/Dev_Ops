# Day 42


1. **Linux**: Explain process management with `ps`, `top`, and `htop`.
   * Managing processes is an essential part of Linux system administration. Here's how these tools help:  

   - **`ps` (Process Status)**:  
     Provides a static snapshot of current processes. Common commands:  
    - `ps aux`: Displays all running processes with detailed information.  
    - `ps -e`: Shows all processes in a simplified format.  

   - **`top`**:  
     A real-time process monitoring tool.  
    - Shows CPU, memory usage, and running processes.  
    - Interactive features allow sorting or killing processes directly.  

   - **`htop`**:  
     An interactive, user-friendly alternative to `top`.  
    - Uses color coding to display resource usage.  
    - Allows searching, filtering, and process management via an intuitive interface.  


2. **Networking**: What is a VPN, and how does it secure data transmission?
   * A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a remote server.  

   **How VPN Secures Data Transmission**:  
    1. **Encryption**: All data sent through the VPN is encrypted using protocols like OpenVPN, IKEv2, or WireGuard.  
    2. **Tunneling**: It encapsulates data within secure "tunnels," preventing unauthorized access.  
    3. **IP Masking**: Hides your real IP address by routing traffic through a VPN server.  
    4. **Data Integrity**: Ensures data is not tampered with during transmission.  


3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain AWS’s Shared Responsibility Model.
   * The AWS **Shared Responsibility Model** outlines the division of security responsibilities between AWS and its customers:  

   - **AWS’s Responsibility (Security *of* the Cloud)**:  
     AWS secures the underlying infrastructure, including hardware, software, networking, and physical facilities.  

   - **Customer’s Responsibility (Security *in* the Cloud)**:  
     Customers are responsible for managing the security of their applications, data, operating systems, and configurations.  

   **Example**:  
   - AWS manages EC2 infrastructure.  
   - Customers secure their EC2 instances, including firewall rules and application security.  


4. **DevOps**: What is version control, and why is it essential?
   * 
5. **Tools & Technology**: Use Git to tag a release version in your repository.
   * 
6. **Scenario**: A new feature is released. How would you manage code versions for easy rollback?
