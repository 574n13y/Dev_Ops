# Day 42


1. **Linux**: Explain process management with `ps`, `top`, and `htop`.
   * Managing processes is an essential part of Linux system administration. Here's how these tools help:  

   - **`ps` (Process Status)**:  
     Provides a static snapshot of current processes. Common commands:  
    - `ps aux`: Displays all running processes with detailed information.  
    - `ps -e`: Shows all processes in a simplified format.  

   - **`top`**:  
     A real-time process monitoring tool.  
    - Shows CPU, memory usage, and running processes.  
    - Interactive features allow sorting or killing processes directly.  

   - **`htop`**:  
     An interactive, user-friendly alternative to `top`.  
    - Uses color coding to display resource usage.  
    - Allows searching, filtering, and process management via an intuitive interface.
