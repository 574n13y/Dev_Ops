1. **Linux**: Use `chmod` for setting file permissions.
   - **Command**:  
  `chmod` changes file and directory permissions in Linux. Permissions are read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`), and they apply to the file owner, group, and others.  
   - **Examples**:  
    - Grant execute permission to the owner:  
      ```bash
      chmod u+x file.txt
      ```
    - Set permissions to read and write for the owner, and read-only for others:  
      ```bash
      chmod 644 file.txt
      ```
    - Allow everyone full permissions (not recommended):  
      ```bash
      chmod 777 file.txt
      ```


2. **Networking**: Explain VPN and its usage.
   - **Definition**:  
  A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public network, enabling users to access resources securely.  
   - **Key Uses**:  
    - Protects data transmission over public networks.  
    - Provides remote workers access to company resources securely.  
    - Bypasses geographic restrictions on content.  
    - Ensures privacy by masking the userâ€™s IP address.  


3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe an EC2 instance and its purpose.
   - **Definition**:  
  An **EC2 instance** (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual server in Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  
   - **Purpose**:  
    - Host applications, websites, or backends.  
    - Scale compute resources up or down based on demand.  
    - Run batch jobs, data analysis, or development environments.  


4. **DevOps**: Explain Infrastructure as Code and its benefits.
   - **Definition**:  
  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** automates infrastructure management using code, enabling consistent deployments. Tools like Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation support IaC.  
   - **Benefits**:  
    - **Consistency**: Ensures infrastructure configurations remain uniform across environments.  
    - **Automation**: Reduces manual errors and speeds up deployment.  
    - **Version Control**: Code can be versioned, allowing rollbacks and tracking of changes.  
    - **Scalability**: Facilitates scaling of infrastructure quickly with minimal manual intervention.  


5. **Tools & Technology**: Install Ansible and run a basic playbook.
6. **Scenario**: Your team needs secure remote access to an application. What would you set up?
