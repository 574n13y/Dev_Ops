1. **Linux**: Use `chmod` for setting file permissions.
   - **Command**:  
  `chmod` changes file and directory permissions in Linux. Permissions are read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`), and they apply to the file owner, group, and others.  
   - **Examples**:  
    - Grant execute permission to the owner:  
      ```bash
      chmod u+x file.txt
      ```
    - Set permissions to read and write for the owner, and read-only for others:  
      ```bash
      chmod 644 file.txt
      ```
    - Allow everyone full permissions (not recommended):  
      ```bash
      chmod 777 file.txt
      ```
