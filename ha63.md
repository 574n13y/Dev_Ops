# Day 63

1. **Linux**: Use `journalctl` to review system logs.
   - `journalctl` is a command-line tool for querying and displaying logs collected by `systemd`.

   #### **Key Commands**
   - View all logs:
     ```bash
     journalctl
     ```
   - Filter logs by a specific service:
     ```bash
     journalctl -u <service_name>
     ```
     Example:  
     ```bash
     journalctl -u sshd
     ```
   - Show logs since a specific time:
     ```bash
     journalctl --since "2025-01-01 10:00:00"
     ```
   - View the most recent logs in real-time:
     ```bash
     journalctl -f
     ```


2. **Networking**: Describe packet filtering and its role in firewalls.
   * **What is Packet Filtering?**
Packet filtering is a method used by firewalls to control network traffic. It inspects each packet (data unit) passing through a network and decides whether to allow or block it based on predefined rules.

    **Key Features**
   - Operates at the **network layer** (OSI Layer 3).
   - Uses criteria like IP address, port number, protocol (TCP/UDP), and packet content.
   - Stateless firewalls only inspect individual packets, while stateful firewalls track connection states.
   
     **Role in Firewalls**
   - **Access Control**: Blocks unauthorized access to specific ports or IPs.
   - **Traffic Filtering**: Ensures only legitimate traffic is allowed.
   - **Security**: Prevents malicious traffic, such as DDoS attacks or unauthorized connections.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain Amazon Inspector and its use cases.

4. **DevOps**: What is static code analysis, and why is it important?

5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up a basic Amazon Inspector scan.

6. **Scenario**: You need to ensure your instances are secure. How would you use Inspector?
