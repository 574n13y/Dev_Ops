1. **Linux**: Manage services using systemctl (e.g., start, stop, enable services).
   - `systemctl` is a command-line utility for managing system services and processes on Linux systems using **systemd**. Here are common tasks:
 
    - **Start a service:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl start <service_name>
      ```
      Example: `sudo systemctl start apache2`
   
    - **Stop a service:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
      ```
   
    - **Restart a service:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
      ```
    
    - **Enable a service to start on boot:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
       ```
    
    - **Disable a service from starting on boot:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
      ```
    
    - **Check the status of a service:**  
      ```bash
      systemctl status <service_name>
      ```
