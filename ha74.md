# Day 75


1. **Linux**: Manage services using systemctl (e.g., start, stop, enable services).
   - `systemctl` is a command-line utility for managing system services and processes on Linux systems using **systemd**. Here are common tasks:
 
    - **Start a service:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl start <service_name>
      ```
      Example: `sudo systemctl start apache2`
   
    - **Stop a service:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
      ```
   
    - **Restart a service:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
      ```
    
    - **Enable a service to start on boot:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
       ```
    
    - **Disable a service from starting on boot:**  
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
      ```
    
    - **Check the status of a service:**  
      ```bash
      systemctl status <service_name>
      ```


2. **Networking**: What is network latency, and what causes it?
   - **Network latency** is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination and back (round trip). It's often measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower latency indicates better network performance.

   **Causes of Network Latency:**
    1. **Physical Distance:** Greater distance between devices increases latency (e.g., between continents).
    
    2. **Congestion:** High traffic on a network can slow down data transfer.
    
    3. **Routing:** Complex routing with multiple hops adds delay.
    
    4. **Hardware Limitations:** Slow routers, switches, or endpoints can introduce delays.
    
    5. **Packet Loss:** Retransmission of lost packets increases latency.
    
    6. **Network Configuration:** Inefficient settings like mismatched MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit).


3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe Amazon GuardDuty and its purpose.

4. **DevOps**: Explain how to implement security best practices in CI/CD pipelines.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Enable GuardDuty in your AWS account.

6. **Scenario**: Your infrastructure needs active threat detection. How would you set this up?
