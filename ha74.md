# Day 74


1. **Linux**: Use `scp` for secure file transfers between servers.
   - `scp` (Secure Copy Protocol) is used to securely transfer files between local and remote systems.  

   **Example Usage:**  
   Copy a file from the local machine to a remote server:  
   ```bash
   scp file.txt username@remote_host:/remote/directory
   ```  

   Copy a file from a remote server to the local machine:  
   ```bash
   scp username@remote_host:/remote/file.txt /local/directory
   ```  

   Copy a directory recursively:  
   ```bash
   scp -r /local/directory username@remote_host:/remote/directory
   ```  


2. **Networking**: Explain the role of DNS in the internet.
   - DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) that computers use to identify each other on the network.  

   **Key Roles of DNS:**
   - **Name Resolution:** Converts domain names to IP addresses.
   - **Load Balancing:** Directs traffic to multiple servers for redundancy and better performance.
   - **Caching:** Speeds up repeated queries by storing responses temporarily.
   - **Domain Aliases:** Links multiple domain names to a single IP address.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Discuss Amazon Athena and its usage.
   - Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.  

   **Key Features:**
   - **Serverless:** No infrastructure to manage.
   - **Integration with S3:** Queries directly on S3 data without moving it.
   - **Pay-per-Query:** Billed based on the amount of data scanned.
   - **Supports Multiple Formats:** Works with formats like CSV, JSON, Parquet, and ORC.

   **Use Cases:**
   - Data analysis and reporting.
   - Log analysis (e.g., CloudTrail logs).
   - Ad hoc queries on large datasets.


4. **DevOps**: Define observability and how it differs from monitoring.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Use Athena to query S3 data.

6. **Scenario**: You need a serverless solution to query stored data. How would you approach it?
