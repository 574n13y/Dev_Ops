1. **Linux**: Use `scp` for secure file transfers between servers.
   - `scp` (Secure Copy Protocol) is used to securely transfer files between local and remote systems.  

   **Example Usage:**  
   Copy a file from the local machine to a remote server:  
   ```bash
   scp file.txt username@remote_host:/remote/directory
   ```  

   Copy a file from a remote server to the local machine:  
   ```bash
   scp username@remote_host:/remote/file.txt /local/directory
   ```  

   Copy a directory recursively:  
   ```bash
   scp -r /local/directory username@remote_host:/remote/directory
   ```  


2. **Networking**: Explain the role of DNS in the internet.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Discuss Amazon Athena and its usage.

4. **DevOps**: Define observability and how it differs from monitoring.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Use Athena to query S3 data.
