ðŸ”¸ AWS Question:
What is an Elastic IP in AWS, and how does it differ from a public IP?
- An **Elastic IP** is a static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate to your AWS account and assign to an EC2 instance. Unlike a regular public IP (which is dynamic and changes if the instance is stopped and started), an Elastic IP remains the same even if the instance restarts or is reattached to a different instance. This is useful for maintaining a consistent endpoint.
