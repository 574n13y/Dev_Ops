# Day 30


**Day 12**
1. **Linux**: Learn about `ps` and check running processes.
   * The `ps` (process status) command in Linux is used to display information about active processes. It can show a snapshot of the processes running at a specific moment, along with details like process IDs (PIDs), CPU usage, memory usage, and more.

   **Common Options:**
   - `ps` — Shows processes for the current shell.
   - `ps aux` — Displays all processes with detailed information:
    - `a` — All processes with a terminal.
    - `u` — User-oriented format.
    - `x` — Includes processes without a terminal.

   **Example Usage:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep process_name
   ```
This searches for a specific process. Use `kill <PID>` to terminate it if needed.


2. **Networking**: What is DHCP, and how does it work?

3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe AWS Lambda.

4. **DevOps**: Define blue-green deployment.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Install Terraform and create a simple EC2 instance.

6. **Scenario**: You need to deploy to multiple environments. How would you set this up?
