# Day 19

1. **Linux**: Change file permissions with `chmod`. What does `chmod 644 file.txt` do?
   - `chmod 644 file.txt` sets permissions on `file.txt` so that:
    - The owner has **read and write** permissions.
    - Group members have **read-only** permissions.
    - Others also have **read-only** permissions.
   - This is a common permission setting for files that should be editable by the owner but readable by others.

2. **Networking**: Explain DNS. How does it resolve domain names?
3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain the purpose of Availability Zones.
4. **DevOps**: Whatâ€™s the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?
5. **Tools & Technology**: Define containerization. How does Docker help?
6. **Scenario**: An application runs slowly. What initial steps would you take to investigate?
