1. **Linux**: Schedule a recurring backup script with `cron`.
   - To schedule a backup script using `cron`, follow these steps:

   * **Step 1: Create a Backup Script**
     ```sh
     #!/bin/bash
     tar -czf /backup/$(date +\%F)-backup.tar.gz /var/www/html
     ```
    - This script compresses `/var/www/html` and saves it in `/backup/` with a date-based filename.

   * **Step 2: Schedule the Script Using `cron`**
    - Edit the crontab:
     ```sh
     crontab -e
     ```
    - Add the following line to run the backup daily at 2 AM:
     ```sh
     0 2 * * * /path/to/backup-script.sh
     ```
