# Day 70

1. **Linux**: Explore process management using `pkill` and `killall`.
   - **`pkill`**: Kills processes by matching the process name or other attributes.  
     Example:  
     ```bash
     pkill -f "python"
     ```  
  This command terminates all Python processes.  

   - **`killall`**: Kills all processes with a given name.  
     Example:  
     ```bash
     killall nginx
     ```  
  This command stops all Nginx processes.  

   * Both commands can use additional flags like `-9` (SIGKILL) for forceful termination or `-15` (SIGTERM) for graceful termination.


2. **Networking**: What is MPLS, and why is it used in networking?

3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain how RDS Read Replicas improve performance.

4. **DevOps**: Define Chaos Engineering and its importance.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up an RDS Read Replica.

6. **Scenario**: Your database has read-heavy traffic. How would you optimize it?
