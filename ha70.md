# Day 70

1. **Linux**: Explore process management using `pkill` and `killall`.
   - **`pkill`**: Kills processes by matching the process name or other attributes.  
     Example:  
     ```bash
     pkill -f "python"
     ```  
  This command terminates all Python processes.  

   - **`killall`**: Kills all processes with a given name.  
     Example:  
     ```bash
     killall nginx
     ```  
  This command stops all Nginx processes.  

   * Both commands can use additional flags like `-9` (SIGKILL) for forceful termination or `-15` (SIGTERM) for graceful termination.


2. **Networking**: What is MPLS, and why is it used in networking?
   * **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)** is a data forwarding technique that uses labels to direct packets through a network instead of traditional IP-based routing.  
   
   - **Benefits**:  
    - Improves **speed** by avoiding complex routing table lookups.  
    - Provides **QoS (Quality of Service)** for voice, video, and other latency-sensitive applications.  
    - Ensures **traffic engineering** by optimizing data flows.  

MPLS is commonly used in enterprise networks, ISPs, and WANs to enhance performance and reliability.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain how RDS Read Replicas improve performance.
   * **RDS Read Replicas** are copies of your primary database used to offload read-heavy traffic, improving scalability and performance.  

   - **Key Features**:  
    - **Asynchronous Replication**: Changes in the primary DB are asynchronously copied to replicas.  
    - **Read Scaling**: Distribute read workloads across replicas.  
    - **High Availability**: Enhance resilience by promoting a read replica to a primary database during failures.  

Use cases include analytics workloads, reporting, and applications with frequent read operations.


4. **DevOps**: Define Chaos Engineering and its importance.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Set up an RDS Read Replica.

6. **Scenario**: Your database has read-heavy traffic. How would you optimize it?
