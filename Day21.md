1. **Linux**: Use `ls -l`. What does each column mean?
   - **Linux (`ls -l`)**: The `ls -l` command lists files in long format. Here’s what each column means:
    - **Column 1**: File type and permissions (e.g., `-rw-r--r--`).
    - **Column 2**: Number of hard links.
    - **Column 3**: Owner of the file.
    - **Column 4**: Group associated with the file.
    - **Column 5**: File size in bytes.
    - **Column 6**: Last modified date and time.
    - **Column 7**: File name.


2. **Networking**: What is an IP address? Find your system's IP address.
    * ** IP address **: An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, allowing it to communicate within the network. To find your system’s IP address on Linux, use:
    - `ip a` (or `ip addr show`), which shows all network interfaces and their IPs.
    - Alternatively, `hostname -I` will directly show your IP address.


3. **Cloud Computing**: What is IaaS? Name two IaaS providers.
4. **DevOps**: Define CI/CD and explain the purpose of each.
5. **Tools & Technology**: Install Docker and run a `hello-world` container.
6. **Scenario**: A team needs to share files on a server. Which permissions would you set up?
