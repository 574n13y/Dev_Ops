# Day 76



1. **Linux**: Create aliases for frequently used commands in `.bashrc`.
   * **What are Aliases?**
     Aliases are shortcuts for commands or groups of commands in Linux. They simplify repetitive tasks.

   * **Steps to Create Aliases**:
    1. **Open the `.bashrc` File**:
       ```bash
       nano ~/.bashrc
       ```
    
    2. **Add Aliases**:
       Example aliases:
       ```bash
       alias ll='ls -lah'
       alias gs='git status'
       alias grep='grep --color=auto'
       alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y'
       ```
    
    3. **Apply Changes**:
       Run the following command to apply changes:
       ```bash
       source ~/.bashrc
       ```
    
    4. **Use Aliases**:
       Type the alias (e.g., `ll`) to execute the corresponding command.


2. **Networking**: What is a proxy server, and when would you use one?
   * #### **What is a Proxy Server?**
     A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers. It forwards requests from clients to the desired server and relays responses back.

   * **When to Use a Proxy Server?**
    1. **Privacy and Anonymity**:
    - Hides the clientâ€™s IP address.
    
    2. **Content Filtering**:
    - Blocks specific websites or content (e.g., in corporate environments).
    
    3. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Caches frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
    
    4. **Security**:
    - Protects internal networks by filtering malicious traffic.
    
    5. **Access Control**:
    - Restricts access to certain resources based on rules.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Discuss Amazon Elasticache and its Redis capabilities.
   * **What is Amazon ElastiCache?**
     Amazon ElastiCache is a managed in-memory data store and cache service for high-speed data access.

   * **Redis Capabilities in ElastiCache**:
    1. **In-Memory Caching**:
    - Stores frequently accessed data for ultra-low latency.
    2. **Data Structures**:
    - Supports lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets.
    3. **Pub/Sub Messaging**:
    - Enables real-time communication between distributed systems.
    4. **Persistence**:
    - Supports snapshots and backups for data durability.
    5. **Replication and High Availability**:
    - Offers read replicas and multi-AZ deployments.
    6. **Scalability**:
    - Auto-scaling capabilities for handling variable workloads.


4. **DevOps**: Define rollback strategies in deployments.

5. **Tools & Technology**: Deploy a Redis instance using Elasticache.

6. **Scenario**: Your application requires caching for fast data retrieval. How would you configure it?
