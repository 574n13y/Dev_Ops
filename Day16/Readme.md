# Day 16

1. **Linux**: What command would you use to display the current directory? Try using both absolute and relative paths.
- **Command to Display the Current Directory:**
    - To display the current working directory using an **absolute path**, use:
      ```bash
      pwd
      ```
      This shows the full path from the root (`/`) to your current directory.
    - To display it in a **relative path** form, navigate with `cd` commands (like `cd ..` to go up one level), then use `pwd` again to see the updated path relative to your starting location.

2. **Networking**: What is the purpose of the `ping` command? Test the network connection to `google.com`.
- **Purpose of the Ping Command:**
    - `ping` checks connectivity and measures the response time between your machine and a remote host. It is commonly used to verify network connections or troubleshoot network issues.
    - To test the network connection to `google.com`, use:
      ```bash
      ping google.com
      ```
      This sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests to Google and shows the latency or any potential packet loss

3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain the difference between public, private, and hybrid clouds.
- **Public, Private, and Hybrid Clouds:**
    - **Public Cloud:** Resources (like storage and servers) are owned and managed by a third-party cloud provider and made available to the general public over the internet. Examples include AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Itâ€™s generally cost-effective and highly scalable.
    - **Private Cloud:** This is a cloud infrastructure that an individual or organization solely owns and uses. It provides greater control over data and security but is generally more expensive and requires in-house management.
    - **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines both public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It provides flexibility by moving workloads between environments, balancing security, scalability, and cost.


4. **DevOps**: Define DevOps in your own words. What are its core principles?
- **Definition of DevOps:**
    - DevOps is a collaborative approach that integrates development and operations teams to streamline software delivery. Its focus is on automating processes, improving collaboration, and enhancing software quality through continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and monitoring.

- **Core Principles of DevOps:**
    - **Collaboration**: Developers and operations teams work closely to create shared goals and processes.
    - **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like code integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management to reduce manual errors.
    - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Build, test, and deploy code frequently and reliably.
    - **Monitoring & Feedback**: Actively monitor applications and use feedback loops to enhance performance, identify issues, and respond quickly.

5. **Tools & Technology**: What is Git? Initialize a Git repository and create your first commit with a README file.
- **Git:**
    - Git is a version control system that tracks code changes, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project while keeping a history of changes.

- **Initialize a Git Repository and Create First Commit:**
    - Start by navigating to your project directory. Then, initialize a new Git repository:
      ```bash
      git init
      ```
    - Next, create a `README.md` file (a simple text file for project info), and add initial content to it:
      ```bash
      echo "# Project Title" > README.md
      ```
    - Add the file to the Git staging area and commit it:
      ```bash
      git add README.md
      git commit -m "Initial commit with README file"
      ```


6. **Scenario**: You are asked to deploy an application in a secure, high-availability setup on a cloud platform. What key steps would you consider?
