1. **Linux**: Describe the `mkdir` command. Create a directory structure.
   - The `mkdir` (make directory) command in Linux is used to create one or more directories. 
   - Basic syntax: `mkdir [options] directory_name`.
   - Common options include:
    - `-p`: Create parent directories if they donâ€™t exist.
    - `-v`: Verbose output, showing each directory created.

   **Example**: To create a directory structure for a project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p project/src/components project/src/utils project/tests
   ```
   This command creates a directory named `project` with subdirectories under `src` for `components`, `utils`, and a separate `tests` directory.


2. **Networking**: Define the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.
   - **IPv4**:
    - IPv4 is a 32-bit address scheme that supports up to 4.3 billion unique IP addresses.
    - Format: Four decimal numbers separated by dots, e.g., `192.168.1.1`.
   - **IPv6**:
    - IPv6 is a 128-bit address scheme introduced to handle the IP address exhaustion issue of IPv4, supporting an enormous number of unique addresses.
    - Format: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Describe the basic concepts of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
4. **DevOps**: Why is version control essential in DevOps?
5. **Tools & Technology**: Use Git to create a branch and merge it.
6. **Scenario**: You need to organize code changes from multiple developers. How would you manage this in Git?
