# Day 85


1. **Linux**: Explore memory usage using `free` and `vmstat`.
   - Monitoring system memory is crucial for optimizing performance.  
    - **`free -m`**: Displays memory usage in MB, showing total, used, and available memory.  
    - **`vmstat -s`**: Provides a summary of memory, CPU, and swap usage.  
    - **`vmstat 2 5`**: Monitors memory and CPU every 2 seconds for 5 iterations.  

   **Example:**  
     ```sh
     free -h
     vmstat 2 5
     ```
    * These commands help detect memory bottlenecks and optimize system performance.


2. **Networking**: Describe CDN and its role in reducing latency.
   - A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** is a globally distributed network of servers that caches content closer to users.  
    - **Reduces Latency**: By serving content from the nearest edge location.  
    - **Improves Availability**: Load distribution across multiple servers.  
    - **Enhances Security**: Protects against DDoS attacks.  

   * **Example in AWS:**  
AWS **CloudFront** caches website assets at edge locations, reducing the load on the origin server.


3. **Cloud Computing**: Explain AWS Lambda and its event-driven execution.
   - AWS **Lambda** is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events.  
    - **Event-Driven**: Triggers include S3 uploads, API Gateway requests, DynamoDB changes, and CloudWatch events.  
    - **Scalability**: Automatically scales with demand.  
    - **Pay-as-You-Go**: Charges are based on execution time.  

   * **Example:**  
A Lambda function can automatically process new files uploaded to an S3 bucket.


4. **DevOps**: Define the term "serverless" and discuss its benefits.
   - **Serverless computing** means running applications without managing infrastructure. It abstracts server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.  

   - **Benefits of Serverless**  
    ✅ **No Server Management**: Focus on code, not infrastructure.  
    ✅ **Automatic Scaling**: Adapts to workload changes.  
    ✅ **Cost-Efficient**: Pay only for execution time.  
    ✅ **Resilience**: Built-in fault tolerance.  

   * **Example:**  
AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions enable serverless architectures.


5. **Tools & Technology**: Create a Lambda function to process S3 file uploads.
   * **Steps**  
    1. **Create an S3 Bucket** to store files.  
    
    2. **Write a Lambda Function** in Python.  
    
    3. **Set Up an S3 Event Trigger** to invoke the function on new uploads.  
    
    4. **Assign IAM Roles** for S3 read access.  

   * **Python Code for Lambda (`lambda_function.py`)**
     ```python
     import json
     import boto3

     def lambda_handler(event, context):
         s3 = boto3.client('s3')

         for record in event['Records']:
             bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
             key = record['s3']['object']['key']
             print(f"New file detected: s3://{bucket}/{key}")

         return {
             'statusCode': 200,
             'body': json.dumps('File processed successfully!')
         }
     ```
   - **Deploy Lambda** in AWS with an S3 trigger.  
   
   - **IAM Role**: Grant permissions to read from S3.


6. **Scenario**: You need a function that automatically processes new files in S3. How would you implement it?
